Introduction to AWS Lambda or AWS Lambda Function:-
----------------------------------------------------------
 > AWS Lambda is a server-less computing platform that allows engineers to create a small function, 
   configure the function in the AWS console, and have the code executed without the need to provision 
   servers-paying only for the resources used during the execution.
 > Simply it is like an editor(vim, Pycharm, sublime text, atom) with some extra features.
 > It supports to run different languages like python, Go, java, Node.js etc... 
   It is installed or running on Amazon Linux Server and we can access/tmp using Lambda Function.

Requirements for AWS Lambda Function:-
-----------------------------------------
 > A Lambda function has a few requirements.
 > The first requirement you need to satisfy is to provide a handler.
     > The handler is the entry point for the Lambda.
     > A Lambda function accepts JSON-formatted input and will usually return the same.

 > The second requirement is that you'll need to specify the runtime environment for the Lambda. The runtime will 
   usually correlate directly with the language you selected to write your function.
 > The final requirement is a trigger.
     > Manual trigger or Run by us.
     > You can configure a Lambda invocation in response to an event, such as a new file uploaded to S3, a change in a DynamoDB table,
       or a similar AWS event. You can also configure the Lambda to respond to requests to AWS API Gateway, 
       or based on a timer triggered by AWS Cloudwatch.

How AWS Lambda Function executes the code for AWS services?
===========================================================
 > By Using Programmatic Access Keys
 > Or by creating AWS IAM Role and attaching the role to AWS Lambda.

Why do we need to copy EBS snapshot from one AWS region to another region?
 > Geographic Expansion:- If we want to launch our application in a new region
 > Migration:-  If we want to migrate our application from one region to another region
 > Disaster Recovery:- If we want to backup ouer data and log file accross different Geographical
                       locations at regular interval to minimize data loss and recovery time.
