The core Concepts of boto3 are:- 
        > Session
        > Resource
        > Client
        > Meta
        > Collections
        > Waiters
        > Paginators

> Session:
     > It is an AWS Management console in our terms
     > Session stores configuration informations(primarily credentials)
     > Allows users to create Service_Clients and Resources.
     > Also boto3 creates a default session for us when needed.

> Resource and Client:
      > We can create particular AWS Service Console like iam console, ec2 console, sns console... etc. by using
        session_objects.
        eg: iam_con=aws_mang_con_root.resource(service_name='iam',region='us-east-1')
            iam_con=aws_mang_con_root.client(service_name='iam',region='us-east-1')
      > Resource is a high-level objet-oriented service access and it is available for some of the aws services.
        (o/p can be performed by using '.' operations)
      > Client is a low-level service access.(o/p is directory)
