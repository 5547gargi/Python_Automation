Paginators:-
------------
 > paginators plays a role when we use boto3 to query AWS resources
 > Like get all ec2_instances, iam users, buckets, objects etc..
 > For query, API calls made to AWS through boto3
 > Generally each API class return 50 to 100 results.
     > Note: S3 returns upto 1000 results.
 > Actually each API call returns a page and each page holds from 50 to 100 results.
 > If you are trying retrive more than one page of results then you need to use paginator to issue
   multiple API requests on your behalf.
 > Boto3 provides Paginators to automatically issue multiple API requests to retrive all the pages.
